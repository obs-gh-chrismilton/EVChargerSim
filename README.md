The provided Python script, named "EVChargerSim9.3.py", is a simulation of an electric vehicle (EV) car charging system. It generates and manages charging sessions for various chargers located in different cities across the United States. The script utilizes three JSON files as input: "config.json", "cities.json", and "chargers.json".

Here's a detailed explanation of what the app does and how it works:

1. Initialization:
   - The script starts by configuring logging settings to store logs in a file named "charging_sessions.log".
   - It loads the necessary configuration and data from the JSON files:
     - "config.json": Contains the API endpoint, authentication token, and simulation parameters.
     - "cities.json": Provides information about various cities, including their name, state, country, latitude, longitude, and population.
     - "chargers.json": Contains a list of chargers for each city, including their ID, location, latitude, and longitude.

2. Simulation Loop:
   - The script enters a continuous loop, where it generates and updates charging sessions based on certain conditions.
   - It checks if the current time falls within the peak hours defined in the configuration.
   - If the conditions are met or randomly determined, it generates new charging sessions for available chargers in each city.

3. Charging Session Generation:
   - For each available charger in a city, the script generates a new charging session.
   - It simulates the charger state based on the city's population, assigning probabilities to different states (In Use, Maintenance, Idle, Interruption).
   - Depending on the state, it sets the appropriate session parameters, such as user ID, vehicle type, estimated charging time, and status message.
   - The generated session includes information like session ID, charger ID, start time, status, location details, charging duration, power output, and more.

4. Session Updates:
   - The script updates the active charging sessions based on their progress and status.
   - It calculates the elapsed time for each session and updates the percentage complete.
   - If a session is in the "In Use" state and not yet completed, it updates the power output based on the percentage complete.
   - If a session is in the "Interruption" state, there's a chance to resolve the interruption and resume charging.
   - Once a session reaches 100% completion, it is marked as "Completed" and additional session details are recorded, such as end time, actual charging time, and total power output.

5. Data Transmission:
   - After updating a session, the script sends the session data to a specified API endpoint.
   - It prepares the session data in JSON format and sends a POST request to the API endpoint with the necessary headers and authentication token.
   - If the data is sent successfully, it logs a success message; otherwise, it logs a warning or error message.

6. Logging:
   - Throughout the execution, the script logs various events, such as loading files, generating sessions, updating sessions, and sending data.
   - The logs are stored in the "charging_sessions.log" file, which is rotated based on size and number of backups.

In summary, this EV car charging simulation app generates and manages charging sessions for different chargers in various cities. It simulates the charging process, updates session progress, and sends the session data to an API endpoint. The app utilizes JSON files for configuration and data input, and it logs the simulation events for monitoring and analysis purposes.
